3. The only way to roll a 6 more or less often would be to manipulate the dice to force a roll of a specific side. In order to know what is "more often", would pertain to rolling different sides of the dice with different probabilities. 

Fair Roll
```{r}
Roll_Die = function(n) sample(1:6, n, rep = T)

Roll_Die(20)
```

Adjusted Roll
```{r}
Roll_Die = function(n) sample(1:6, n, rep = T,prob = c(rep(1/7, 5), 2/7))

Roll_Die(20)

```

4. The average for women in the sample was 42.72 and the average age for men in the sample was 40.35.
